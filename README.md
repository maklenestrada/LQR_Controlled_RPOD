# LQR-Controlled RPOD Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)-controlled system based on the discretized Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) equations. I am currently working on using fmincon to find an optimal control input.

## Features
Discretized CW equations for spacecraft dynamics.
LQR controller implemented to compute the full-state feedback gain matrix.
Saturation limits for control input.
Visualization of the state trajectory and control input over time.
